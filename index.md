Hi, currently I am a PhD student at the [MPIDR](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/institute/staff_directory_1899/beatriz_sofa_gil_3775.htm). I have a master on Computing and Industrial Mathematics from the Center of Mathematics Research, CIMAT, and a B.S. in Actuarial Science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, UNAM. 

My interests are on demography, programming, and statistics. I love coding, looking for patterns, and visualizing data.
